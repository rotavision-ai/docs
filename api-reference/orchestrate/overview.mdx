## Introduction

Orchestrate enables building and deploying multi-agent AI workflows for complex enterprise tasks. Coordinate specialized agents, manage state, and implement human-in-the-loop controls.

## Key Features

### Agent Types

| Agent | Capability |
|-------|------------|
| **LLM Agent** | Natural language reasoning and generation |
| **Code Agent** | Execute Python/JavaScript code |
| **Search Agent** | Web and document search |
| **Tool Agent** | Call external APIs and tools |
| **Human Agent** | Human-in-the-loop approval/input |

### Workflow Patterns

- **Sequential**: Agents run in order
- **Parallel**: Multiple agents run simultaneously
- **Conditional**: Branch based on results
- **Loop**: Iterate until condition met
- **Map-Reduce**: Process items in parallel, aggregate results

### Enterprise Features

- State persistence across executions
- Retry and error handling
- Audit logging
- Cost controls and budgets
- Human approval gates

## Quick Example

```python
from rotavision import Rotavision

client = Rotavision()

# Create a research workflow
workflow = client.orchestrate.create_workflow(
    name="Market Research Pipeline",
    agents=[
        {
            "id": "researcher",
            "type": "llm",
            "model": "gpt-5-mini",
            "system_prompt": "You are a market research analyst..."
        },
        {
            "id": "searcher",
            "type": "search",
            "sources": ["web", "news", "academic"]
        },
        {
            "id": "writer",
            "type": "llm",
            "model": "claude-4.5-sonnet",
            "system_prompt": "You are a report writer..."
        }
    ],
    steps=[
        {"agent": "researcher", "action": "plan_research", "input": "{{topic}}"},
        {"agent": "searcher", "action": "search", "input": "{{researcher.queries}}"},
        {"agent": "writer", "action": "write_report", "input": "{{searcher.results}}"}
    ]
)

# Run the workflow
execution = client.orchestrate.run_workflow(
    workflow_id=workflow.id,
    inputs={"topic": "Electric vehicle adoption in India 2026"}
)

# Get results
result = client.orchestrate.get_execution(execution.id)
print(result.outputs["report"])
```
