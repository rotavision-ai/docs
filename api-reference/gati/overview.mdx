## Key Features

### Route Optimization

- **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** solving at scale
- Support for time windows, capacity constraints
- Real-time traffic integration
- Multi-depot and multi-day planning

### Demand Forecasting

- Predict demand by location and time
- Factor in events, weather, holidays
- Indian market-specific patterns (festivals, cricket matches)

### Fleet Analytics

- Real-time vehicle tracking
- Driver performance scoring
- Maintenance prediction
- Fuel efficiency analysis

## Quick Example

```python
from rotavision import Rotavision

client = Rotavision()

# Optimize delivery routes
result = client.gati.optimize_routes(
    vehicles=[
        {"id": "v1", "capacity": 100, "start_location": {"lat": 12.97, "lng": 77.59}},
        {"id": "v2", "capacity": 100, "start_location": {"lat": 12.97, "lng": 77.59}}
    ],
    orders=[
        {"id": "o1", "location": {"lat": 12.93, "lng": 77.63}, "demand": 10, "time_window": ["09:00", "12:00"]},
        {"id": "o2", "location": {"lat": 12.95, "lng": 77.55}, "demand": 15, "time_window": ["10:00", "14:00"]},
        # ... more orders
    ],
    options={
        "optimize_for": "distance",
        "traffic": True,
        "return_to_depot": True
    }
)

for route in result.routes:
    print(f"Vehicle {route.vehicle_id}: {len(route.stops)} stops, {route.distance_km:.1f} km")
```
