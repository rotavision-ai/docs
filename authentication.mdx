## API Keys

All API requests to Rotavision require authentication using an API key. You can create and manage API keys from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.rotavision.com/settings/api-keys).

### Key Types

| Type | Prefix | Usage |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Live** | `rv_live_` | Production environments |
| **Test** | `rv_test_` | Development and testing |

<Warning>
  Never expose your live API keys in client-side code, public repositories, or logs. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
</Warning>

## Authentication Methods

### Bearer Token (Recommended)

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.rotavision.com/v1/vishwas/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rv_live_abc123..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model_id": "my-model"}'
```

### Using SDKs

Our SDKs handle authentication automatically:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from rotavision import Rotavision

# Option 1: Pass directly
client = Rotavision(api_key="rv_live_...")

# Option 2: Environment variable (recommended)
# Set ROTAVISION_API_KEY in your environment
client = Rotavision()
```

```typescript Node.js
import { Rotavision } from '@rotavision/sdk';

// Option 1: Pass directly
const client = new Rotavision({
  apiKey: 'rv_live_...'
});

// Option 2: Environment variable (recommended)
// Set ROTAVISION_API_KEY in your environment
const client = new Rotavision();
```

```java Java
import com.rotavision.Rotavision;

// Option 1: Pass directly
Rotavision client = new Rotavision("rv_live_...");

// Option 2: Environment variable (recommended)
// Set ROTAVISION_API_KEY in your environment
Rotavision client = new Rotavision();
```

</CodeGroup>

## API Key Scopes

When creating an API key, you can restrict its permissions to specific products:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `vishwas:read` | Read fairness analyses and reports |
| `vishwas:write` | Create new fairness analyses |
| `guardian:read` | Read monitoring data and alerts |
| `guardian:write` | Configure monitors and log inferences |
| `dastavez:read` | Read extraction results |
| `dastavez:write` | Submit documents for extraction |
| `sankalp:proxy` | Make LLM proxy requests |
| `orchestrate:read` | Read workflow executions |
| `orchestrate:write` | Create and run workflows |
| `gati:read` | Read fleet and route data |
| `gati:write` | Submit optimization requests |

### Example: Read-Only Key

```json
{
  "name": "Analytics Dashboard",
  "scopes": [
    "vishwas:read",
    "guardian:read",
    "gati:read"
  ]
}
```

## Organization & Project Keys

For larger teams, Rotavision supports hierarchical key management:

```
Organization (Acme Corp)
├── Project: Production
│   ├── Key: Backend Service (all scopes)
│   └── Key: Analytics (read-only)
├── Project: Staging
│   └── Key: CI/CD Pipeline
└── Project: Development
    └── Key: Local Testing
```

<Info>
  Project-scoped keys inherit organization-level rate limits but can have additional restrictions applied.
</Info>

## IP Allowlisting

For enhanced security, you can restrict API keys to specific IP addresses or CIDR ranges:

```json
{
  "name": "Production Backend",
  "allowed_ips": [
    "203.0.113.0/24",
    "198.51.100.42"
  ]
}
```

## Key Rotation

We recommend rotating API keys periodically. The dashboard supports:

1. **Create new key** with the same scopes
2. **Update your application** with the new key
3. **Verify functionality** in production
4. **Revoke the old key**

<Tip>
  Use a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.) to automate key rotation without application deployments.
</Tip>

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables" icon="terminal">
    Never hardcode API keys in your source code. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.

    ```bash
    export ROTAVISION_API_KEY=rv_live_...
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use minimal scopes" icon="lock">
    Only grant the permissions your application actually needs. A monitoring dashboard doesn't need write access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Separate test and live keys" icon="flask">
    Use `rv_test_` keys in development and CI/CD. Never use live keys in non-production environments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor key usage" icon="chart-line">
    Review API key usage in your dashboard. Investigate unexpected patterns or unauthorized access attempts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable IP allowlisting" icon="shield">
    For production keys, restrict access to known IP addresses of your servers.
  </Accordion>
